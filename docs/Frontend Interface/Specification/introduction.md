NITCbase provides a command line interface to the users (students) in which they can input and execute any database queries. This interface translates the SQL-like queries given as input to a set of lower-layer function calls.
Similar to XFS interface, Front-end interface also supports **three** types of commands, namely:

1. [Script Commands](./script.md)
2. [Data Definition Language Commands ](./ddl.md)
3. [Data Manipulation Language Commands](./dml.md)
