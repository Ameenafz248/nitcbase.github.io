NITCbase supports two user interfaces namely, [XFS Interface](../Misc/XFS%20Interface.md) and [Frontend Interface](../Design/Frontend.md). The commands supported by the two interfaces fall into the following **four** categories:

1. [Data Definition Language(DDL) Commands ](./ddl.md)
2. [Data Manipulation Language(DML) Commands](./dml.md)
3. [XFS + External File System Commands](./efs.md)
4. [Script Commands](./script-cmds.md)

Among the above commands, XFS Interface supports all four categories whereas Frontend Interface supports Data Definition Language(DDL), Data Manipulation Language(DML) and Script commands.
