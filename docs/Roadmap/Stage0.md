:::info Learning Objectives

At the end of this experiment, you will have setup the environment to build NITCbase. You will also have grasped a basic understanding of how to use the XFS Interface and the [GNU Debugger(gdb)](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/) for the purposes of implementing NITCbase.

:::

Please follow the setting up procedure from [here](../Misc/Installation%20Guidelines.md).

After setup of the system is done correctly the directory structure given [here](../Misc/Installation%20Guidelines.md#files-and-directories) will be created. You can also go through the notable directories and files available in the same link.

Other directories in the structure will be visited at the right stages when you proceed through the roadmap.

TODO add xfs interface stuff here. and gdb stuff too perhaps?
