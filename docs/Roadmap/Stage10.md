## Introduction

A relation in a production database can contain millions or records and might span over a large number of disk blocks. An index would help us to traverse these disk blocks much quicker than a linear search over every record. If we find ourselves frequently doing search operations on the values of one specific attribute of the relation, then creating an index on that attribute will immensely speed up the search.

For example, consider the relation `Student` having 5 attributes (`Roll No`, `Name`, `Marks`, `Grade`, `Attendance`). As an administrator, we might have to frequently get the subset of students having `Marks` greater than some amount `M`. Instead of going through each and every record and checking if it satisfies our condition, the index allows us to easily reach the first record with `Marks` > `M`. We know that in a B+ tree, every subsequent leaf node will also satisfy this condition (Why?). You can see how this would save us a lot of time.

In NITCbase, indexes are B+ trees with **internal nodes of size 100**, and **leaf nodes of size 63**. Each of these nodes will be stored in a separate disk block. A fully filled internal node would consist of a 100 attribute values from various records and 101 pointers to their respective children. A pointer here refers to the block number of the corresponding internal or leaf index block. A fully filled leaf node would consist of 63 attribute values from various records along with the block number and slot number where the record containing this attribute can be found.

The [attribute catalog](../Design/Physical%20Layer.md#attribute-catalog) stores whether a particular attribute of a relation has an index. If it does, the `RootBlock` field of the attribute catalog will store the block number of the root block of the index.

**Read the documentation for [internal index blocks](../Design/Physical%20Layer.md#internal-index-block-structure) and [leaf index blocks](../Design/Physical%20Layer.md#leaf-index-block-structure) before proceeding further.**

A high-end database might automatically create and dispose of indexes as required by the program without user intervention. In NITCbase, the user is expected to decide when the index is to be created and dropped (using the [CREATE INDEX](../User%20Interface%20Commands/ddl.md#create-index) and [DROP INDEX](../User%20Interface%20Commands/ddl.md#drop-index) commands of the [Schema Layer](../Design/Schema%20Layer.md)). Note that we will not be implementing these commands in the present stage and will instead be using them through the XFS Interface.

Q. Assume that we have an empty database with no relations. We start it and create a table `LibraryBooks(name STR, id NUM, shelf: NUM, borrower: STR)`. We then insert 1000 records into the relation `LibraryBooks` in descending order of their `id`. It is given that the records have `id` from 1000 to 1.

1. If we were to do a search for a book with `id` > 500, which book would we get? What's the corresponding _record-id=(block, slot)_?
2. We then create an index on `id` for `LibraryBooks`. How many index blocks would be created?
3. How many entries does the root block have? What is the rightmost value in the root node of the B+ tree?
4. If we were to again do a search for a book with `id` > 500, which book would we get? What is the index of the entry corresponding to the found record in the leaf node of the B+ tree?

**Answer**

1. We will get the record with `id`=1000 because that's the first record that will satisfy the condition when a linear search is done. Since this record will be the first relation in the first block of the relation, we get that the rec-id is `{6, 1}`.
2. There will be 31 leaf index blocks and 1 internal index block.
3. The root block will have 30 entries. The rightmost value in the node will be 968/969 depending on the implementation.
4. We would get the book with `id` 501 because the records will be sorted in ascending order in the leaf node. A B+ search will return the first node in the leaf that satisfies the condition.

## Implementation

In this stage, you will implement the B+ search operations on a relation in the `BPlusTree::bPlusSearch()` function. We will also modify the functions we designed earlier to do an indexed search if an index is available.

Similar to the linear search operation that implemented in the [Block Access Layer](../Design/Block%20Access%20Layer.md), the `BPlusTree::bPlusSearch()` function, when called for the first time, will return the first record that satisfies the given condition. Every subsequent call to the function will return a proceeding record that satisfies the condition until there are no more records to be returned.

Recall that in `BlockAccess::linearSearch()` the position of the previously returned record was stored in the [RelCacheTable](../Design/Cache%20Layer/RelCacheTable.md) in the `searchIndex` field of the entry corresponding to the relation. This field was used to keep track of the position while searching through the records. To restart a search from the beginning, we would have to reset the search index using the `RelCacheTable::resetSearchIndex()` function.

The `BPlusTree::bPlusSearch()` function too makes use of a `searchIndex` field to keep track of it's previous search position in the leaf of the B+ tree. For a B+ search on the B+ tree of an attribute, the search index is stored in the linked list entry corresponding to the attribute in the [AttrCacheTable](../Design/Cache%20Layer/AttrCacheTable.md) entry of the relation. The search index can be reset using the `AttrCacheTable::resetSearchIndex()` function.

**Read the documentation about [indexing in NITCbase](../Misc/Indexing.md) before proceeding further.**

To add this functionality, we will need to implement the following:

- The [Buffer Layer](../Design/Buffer%20Layer/intro.md) methods to read from index blocks.
  - Here, we introduce three new classes [IndBuffer](../Design/Buffer%20Layer/IndBuffer.md#class-indbuffer), [IndInternal](../Design/Buffer%20Layer/IndBuffer.md#class-indinternal) and [IndLeaf](../Design/Buffer%20Layer/IndBuffer.md#class-indleaf).
  - `IndBuffer` is an [abstract class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_type) which defines [virtual methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_function) to access and update entries in index blocks. Note that `IndBuffer` cannot be instantiated owing to it being abstract.
  - `IndInternal` and `IndLeaf` are children of `IndBuffer` used for buffered access to leaf blocks and internal index blocks respectively of the B+ tree.
- The [Cache Layer](../Design/Cache%20Layer/intro.md) methods to read and update the search index in the attribute cache
- The [B+ Tree Layer](../Design/B%2B%20Tree%20Layer.md) method to search through a B+ tree present in the disk
- Modifications to the [Block Access Layer](../Design/Block%20Access%20Layer.md) to call the B+ search if an index is present

A sequence diagram documenting the call sequence for a call to the `BlockAccess::search()` function is shown below.

When an index is created on an attribute of a relation, the attribute catalog entry of the attribute is updated to store the block number of the root block of the B+ tree on the disk. This may be a leaf index block or an internal index block.

Recall that the `search()` function in the [Block Access Layer](../Design/Block%20Access%20Layer.md) is used to either do a B+ search or a linear search depending on the presence of an index. Our earlier implementation did not account for indexes and directly called the `BlockAccess:linearSearch()` function. We now modify that function to check the attribute catalog entry and call the [`BPlusTree::bPlusSearch()`](../Design/B%2B%20Tree%20Layer.md#bplustreebplussearch) function if there is an index (we will implement this function later in this stage).

Implement the `BlockAccess::search()` function by looking at the [design docs](../Design/Block%20Access%20Layer.md#blockaccess--search).
