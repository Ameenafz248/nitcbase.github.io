# Stage 9 : Selection and Projection on Relations (10 hours)

:::note Learning Objectives

- Complete the implementation of the NITCbase commands that do the following operations
  - selection
  - projection
  - a combination of both selection and projection

:::

## Introduction

In previous stages, you had implemented linear search on relations and a rudimentary version of the [SELECT](../User%20Interface%20Commands/dml.md#select--from-table-where) command to select records from a relation. In this stage, we will complete the implementation of the select operation and the projection operation.

As discussed earlier, a selection operation in relational algebra involves fetching all records that satisfy some condition. Our previous implementation would select records from a relation and print them to the console. The actual NITCbase specification defines the select operation as selecting records from a relation and creating a new relation with that subset of records. Since we have now implemented relation creation, we can finish our implementation of the [SELECT \* FROM TABLE WHERE](../User%20Interface%20Commands/dml.md#select--from-table-where) command.

A projection operation is used to pick a subset of columns from the relation. In NITCbase, doing a project operation on a relation would result in the creation of a new relation with a subset of the attributes of the source relation. The required attributes will be picked from each record and inserted into the new relation.

Once you implement the `select()` and `project()` operations in the [Algebra Layer](../Design/Algebra%20Layer.md), you will be able to add the following commands to your NITCbase using a combination of the two functions.

| [SELECT \* FROM RelName INTO TargetName](../User%20Interface%20Commands/dml.md#select--from-table)                                              | projection (clone relation)  |
| [SELECT Attr1,Attr2 FROM RelName INTO TargetName](../User%20Interface%20Commands/dml.md#select-attrlist-from-table)                             | projection                   |
| [SELECT Attr1,Attr2 FROM RelName INTO TargetName WHERE Attr `op` value](../User%20Interface%20Commands/dml.md#select-attrlist-from-table-where) | selection **and** projection |

## Implementation

A sequence diagram documenting the call sequence involved in a call to the [SELECT AttrList FROM TABLE WHERE](../User%20Interface%20Commands/dml.md##select-attrlist-from-table-where) command is shown below. The calls to the [Cache Layer](../Design/Cache%20Layer/intro.md) and [Buffer Layer](../Design/Buffer%20Layer/intro.md) are omitted for the sake of clarity.

  }
```

In the [Block Access Layer](../Design/Block%20Access%20Layer.md), we implement the `project()` function. This function is used to fetch every record of the relation one by one. Similar to the `linearSearch()` function you implemented earlier, `project()` makes use of the `searchIndex` in the relation cache to keep track of the last read record. As a result of this, `RelCacheTable::resetSearchIndex()` will need to be called before a project operation is done.

<details>
<summary>BlockAccess/BlockAccess.cpp</summary>

Implement this function by looking at the algorithm given in the [design docs](../Design/Block%20Access%20Layer.md#blockaccess--project).

</details>

In the [Algebra Layer](../Design/Algebra%20Layer.md), you had already implemented part of the `select()` function in previous stages. In this stage, you will modify the function to create a new relation and insert the selected records into the new relation. This will be the final state of this function.

We also add two new overloaded functions `project(srcRel, targetRel)` and `project(srcRel, targetRel, numAttrs, attrs)` which are responsible for the [SELECT \* FROM TABLE](../User%20Interface%20Commands/dml.md#select--from-table) and [SELECT AttrList FROM TABLE](../User%20Interface%20Commands/dml.md#select-attrlist-from-table) commands respectively. Note that the `project(relId, record)` function is used to create a copy of the source relation.

<details>
<summary>Algebra/Algebra.cpp</summary>

Implement the following functions looking at their respective design docs

- [`Algebra::project(srcRel, targetRel)`](../Design/Algebra%20Layer.md#all-attributes-copy-relation)
- [`Algebra::project(srcRel, targetRel, numAttrs, attrs)`](../Design/Algebra%20Layer.md#specified-attributes)

</details>

Finally, in the [Frontend Programming Interface](../Design/Frontend.md#frontend-programming-interface), we update the handlers of the functions to call the respective [Algebra Layer](../Design/Algebra%20Layer.md) methods.

Contrary to what we are used to, the implementation of the `Frontend::select_attrlist_from_table_where()` function involves more than just a call to a lower layer method. Since this operation is a combination of both selection and projection, it requires calls to both the corresponding methods.

The function implementation involves creating an intermediate relation which holds the result of one of the operations. The second operation is done on this intermediate relation, following which the intermediate relation is deleted. NITCbase reserves the name of this intermediate relation as `.temp` (available to you as the constant [TEMP](/constants)).

<details>
<summary>Frontend/Frontend.cpp</summary>

Implement the following functions looking at their respective design docs

- [`Frontend::select_from_table()`](../Design/Frontend.md#frontend--select_from_table)
- [`Frontend::select_attrlist_from_table()`](../Design/Frontend.md#frontend--select_attrlist_from_table)
- [`Frontend::select_from_table_where()`](../Design/Frontend.md#frontend--select_from_table_where)
- [`Frontend::select_attrlist_from_table_where()`](../Design/Frontend.md#frontend--select_attrlist_from_table_where)

</details>

## Exercises

**Q1**. Create a relation `Toys(id NUM, name STR, colour STR, stock NUM)` and insert the values from [this file](/roadmap_files/s9toys.txt) into it. Then, run the following commands in your NITCbase.

```sql
SELECT name,colour FROM Toys INTO ToyColours;
SELECT * FROM Toys INTO ToysForSale WHERE stock>10;
SELECT * FROM Toys INTO ToysCopy;
SELECT id,name FROM Toys INTO BlueToys WHERE colour=blue;
```

Verify the contents of the new relations in the XFS Interface using either the [PRINT TABLE](../User%20Interface%20Commands/efs.md#print-relation) command or [EXPORT](../User%20Interface%20Commands/efs.md#export-relation) command.
