NITCbase has a seven layer design. This section provides documentation for each of the seven layers and certain additional design specific details.
Contents include:
1. Algebra Layer
2. Schema Layer
3. Cache Layer
4. B+ tree Layer
5. Block Access Layer
6. Buffer Layer
7. Physical Layer

In addition to above layers, NITCbase provides a command line interface called [Frontend Interface](../Design/Frontend.md) to the users (students) in which they can input and execute any database queries which forms part of the Frontend Layer. 
This layer is responsible for translating the SQL-like queries given as input to a set of lower-layer function calls.

The following diagram shows the organization of different layers of NITCbase and important C++ classes present within them. 
You can use this diagram to navigate to different parts of this section by clicking on the relevant layers.
